# Database Migration Plan for Dashboard Features

This document outlines the plan for implementing the database models needed to support the dashboard features like user profiles, teams, athletic stats, and relationships between different user roles.

## Overview

The proposed schema adds comprehensive models to support:
- User authentication and role-based access control
- User profiles for different roles (Athlete, Coach, Scout, Trainer, Counselor, Parent)
- Team management and membership
- Athletic performance tracking
- Academic records
- Recruitment status tracking
- Health and wellness monitoring
- Communication between users

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Base User and Authentication Models

- Implement the `User` model as the foundation for all user types
- Implement the `Role` and `Permission` models for role-based access control
- Implement the `Profile` model for storing user profile information

### 2. Role-Specific Models

- Implement role-specific models:
  - `Athlete`
  - `Coach`
  - `Scout`
  - `Trainer`
  - `Counselor`
  - `Parent`

### 3. Team and Membership Models

- Implement the `Sport` and `Position` models
- Implement the `Team` model
- Implement the `TeamMember` model to track team memberships

### 4. Athletic Performance Models

- Implement the `StatCategory` model to define different types of athletic statistics
- Implement the `AthleticStat` model to track athlete performance metrics
- Implement the `Event` model to track games, practices, and other events

### 5. Academic and Recruitment Models

- Implement the `AcademicRecord` and `Course` models
- Implement the `RecruitmentStatus` model
- Implement the `College` and `CollegeInterest` models

### 6. Health and Communication Models

- Implement the `HealthRecord` model
- Implement the `Message` and `Notification` models

## Database Migration Strategy

1. **Create Initial Migration**:
   - Generate the initial migration file using Prisma CLI
   - Review the migration file to ensure all models are properly defined

2. **Test Migration**:
   - Apply the migration to a test database
   - Verify that all tables are created correctly
   - Test relationships between models

3. **Seed Initial Data**:
   - Create a seed script to populate the database with initial data
   - Include default roles, permissions, and sports

4. **Apply Migration to Production**:
   - Once testing is complete, apply the migration to the production database

## Frontend Integration

After implementing the database models, update the frontend components to use the new data models:

1. Update authentication and user profile components
2. Update dashboard components to display role-specific data
3. Implement components for team management
4. Implement components for athletic performance tracking
5. Implement components for academic and recruitment tracking

## API Development

Develop API endpoints to interact with the new database models:

1. User authentication and profile management endpoints
2. Team management endpoints
3. Athletic performance tracking endpoints
4. Academic and recruitment tracking endpoints
5. Communication endpoints

## Security Considerations

- Ensure proper access control for sensitive data
- Implement field-level permissions where necessary
- Use middleware to validate user roles and permissions
- Encrypt sensitive data like health records

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Set up database monitoring
- Create backup and recovery procedures
- Plan for future schema updates
